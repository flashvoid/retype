# retype

re-types your standard input

```
echo -e "passwd\noldpassword\nnewpassword\nnewpassword\n" | ./retype -interval 100
```

This is a simple tool that should have been written many years ago by people much smarter then me.  
Credits to linux community for ./dev uinput and github.com/bendahl for all the real work.
